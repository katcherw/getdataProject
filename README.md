getdataProject
==============

The purpose of this project is to analyze accelerometer data measured
by smartphones.

The output of the analysis is a dataframe called tidy which
averages each variable grouped by subject and activity.

To generate the tidy dataframe, run the runAnalysis.R file.

The files in this project are as follows:

* runAnalysis.R - r code to load data files and generate tidy data frame.
* UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt - training subjects for the training data
* UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt - training data
* UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt - activities for training data
* UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt - test subjects for test data
* UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt - test data
* UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt - activities for test data
* UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt - variable names for data columns
* UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt - activity strings
